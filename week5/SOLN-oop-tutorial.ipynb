    "\n",
    "notice that the first line in this function contains a call to super(). this is because the Planet class is actually a child class (or subclass) of the Turtle class (notice the parameter in the definition of the Planet class). calling super() accesses the parent class's definition of that function - in this case the constructor with the shape defined. notice how similar this is to the call to the Turtle class when we defined the sun object. this similarity is because both are calling the same Turtle constructor under the hood.   \n",
